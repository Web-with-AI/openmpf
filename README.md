# Overview

**NOTE: The Media Processing Framework (MPF) project has been renamed to OpenMPF. Bear with us
while the documentation and other artifacts are updated.**

This repository contains source code for the Open Media Processing Framework (OpenMPF).
This is the top-level repository which holds the OpenMPF core. Components (the things that do the work) can be found in other repositories under this project.

For a latest snapshot of what tasks are being worked on, what's available to pick up, and where we stand as a whole, check out our workboard @ https://overv.io/~/openmpf/.

The trunk subdirectory is divided into various maven modules. Of note are the
node manager, which controls the OpenMPF services running on a given node, and the
workflow manager, which is the web application server.
