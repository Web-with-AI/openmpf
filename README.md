This is the top-level repository (the OpenMPF core).

The mpf_components subdirectory contains submodule repositories.

The trunk subdirectory is divided into various maven modules. Of note are the
node manager, which controls the OpenMPF services running on a given node, and the
workflow manager, which is the web application server.
